# Scatter plot graph created with D3.js library

Scatter plot is created with the following data source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json.

Tooltip is added for additional information about each cyclist (name, country, doping allegations, etc.).

Also, legend for "Doping allegations" and "No doping allegations" is added, as well as different colorization of those two categories.

This library is great to get familiarized with DOM manipulation via JS. If you have any advice on how to improve the code, let me know.
